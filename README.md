## Environmental Setup

The code is tested in:
- Python 3.6
- Pytorch 1.6.0
- Cuda 10.1
- [Deformable Convolution v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.11168). Following [Zooming Slowmo](https://github.com/Mukosame/Zooming-Slow-Mo-CVPR-2020), we adopt [CharlesShang's implementation](https://github.com/CharlesShang/DCNv2) in the submodule.

If you are using Anaconda, the following command can be used to build the environment:


```
conda create -n videoinr
conda activate videoinr
conda install pytorch= torchvision torchaudio cudatoolkit=10.2 -c pytorch

cd models/modules/DCNv2/
python setup.py install
```

## Demo

1. Download the pre-trained model from [google drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JW_-ef_oHAmPZkssiXvOspIAn_poymK9/view?usp=sharing).

2. Convert your video of interest to a sequence of images. This process can be completed by many apps, e.g. ffmpeg and AdobePR.

The folder that contains this image sequence should have a structure as follows:
```
data_path
├── img_1.jpg
├── img_2.jpg
├── ...
├── img_n.jpg
```

3. Using VideoINR for performing space-time super-resolution. You can adjust up-sampling scales by setting different `space_scale` and `time_scale`.
```
python demo.py --space_scale 4 --time_scale 8 --data_path [YOUR_DATA_PATH]
```

4. The output would be three folders including low-resolution images, bicubic-upsampling images, and the results of VideoINR.
